If you've never played BlackJack before, no worries! Here is a quick rundown!
You, being Player one, will hit the deal button, you'll be dealt two cards. Depending on the cards deal you can choose to "hit" (add another card to your hand) or "stay" (keep the cards in your hand as the are). The player closest to or equal to 21 wins!
